Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).

Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.

[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is 0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]

The result should be with two decimal place.To get two decimal place refer the below-mentioned print statement :

float cost=670.23;

System.out.printf(“You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip”,cost);

Input Format

Example: Sample Input 1:

Enter the no of liters to fill the tank 20

Enter the distance covered 150

Constraints

quantity or distance is non-negative values.

Output Format

Sample Output 1:

Liters/100KM 13.33

Miles/gallons 17.64

Explanation:

For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters,
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons (20*0.2642)=5.284,
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64

Invalid Input

code

liters = int(input())
distance = int(input())
if liters <= 0 or distance <= 0:
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    
    liters_per_100km = (liters / distance) * 100

    
    miles = distance * 0.6214
    gallons = liters * 0.2642
    miles_per_gallon = miles / gallons

    print("Liters/100KM")
    print(format(liters_per_100km, ".2f"))
    print("Miles/gallons")
    print(format(miles_per_gallon, ".2f"))
